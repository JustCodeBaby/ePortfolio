        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            Completing the Computer Science program and building my ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths, define my professional goals, and prepare for a successful career in the field. This program gave me hands on experience that improved my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and ability to develop clear and organized code. I now feel confident in addressing real-world challenges and contributing to the technology industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            I focused on enhancing my abilities in data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and database management. For example, I optimized sorting algorithms to improve performance and implemented secure CRUD operations in a database using SQLite. By learning secure coding practices, like using prepared statements and validating inputs, I gained a strong foundation in building reliable and secure applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The artifacts in my ePortfolio demonstrate my growth as a computer science professional. My software design project highlights performance optimization and error handling. The algorithms project shows my ability to improve efficiency with optimized sorting methods. The database project reflects my skills in secure database management and transaction handling. Together, these artifacts showcase my technical abilities, problem solving skills, and focus on security.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, this program has prepared me to work effectively as a computer science professional. I have developed skills in problem solving, secure software development, and producing clean and efficient code. My ePortfolio highlights these strengths and reflects my readiness to contribute to real-world projects and make a meaningful impact in the field.
